//You are on a number where your position is denoted by x. You want to travel to another point on the number line y. Normally,
//        the distance to y is simply |yâˆ’x|. However, you know there is a teleporter on the number line denoted by two positions
//        a and b. You can teleport from a directly to b or from b directly to a. Teleporting counts as travelling 0 distance.
//        What is the minimum distance you must travel to get from x to y.
//
//        Input
//        3 10 8 2
//        Output
//        3
/* go from 3 to telporter 2 distance 1km from telporter 2 to teleporter 8 0km distance
from 8 to 10 distance 2km so total 3km*/

//One path is obviously travelling from x to y.
//
//        What are the other two paths possible ?
//
//        One out of the two paths is travelling from x to a , teleporting from a to b, and then travelling from b to y.
//
//        PS: Have seen some of the implementations for this problem go complex. One simple trick to reduce implementation is
//        use predefined libraries like abs to code |y-x|
